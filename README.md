# TurboHUD Config

It's my own take at configuring TurboHUD... I don't want to set up my own theme, nor plan to share this, so I'm directly editing the default config files.
I know it's bad, and its getting a pain in the arse to configure every time an update happen, so why not using git's change tool?
